Lscripts happened to come into existence as a part of my personal research work. It was an attempt to reduce my manual effort to setup my systems. I hope you will discover some cool tricks using it and surely will develop the love-hate relationship with `lscripts-docker` framework.

It will give you a perspective of what happens when shell scripts limits are pushed to be used in conjunction with machine learning and deep learning projects. When the shell scripts and the command line tools are combined with python it provide for the powerful triad for a cadence.
