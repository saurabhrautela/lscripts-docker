## Roadmap
> Todo items


* To make better is to create select list of commands being exposed and not the actual function name using associative array and provide menu to the user to select which command to excecute
* share the python virtual environment with the host machine
* package and release to apt repo


**Docker**
* check if docker with same hostname inside docker is valid for multiple container networking or docker hostname for each container is to be different; in other words what's the implication of hostname being same or different inside the docker container
