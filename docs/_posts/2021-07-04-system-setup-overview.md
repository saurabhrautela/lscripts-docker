## Summary on Software Stack Setup
> Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

### Key Learnings & Takeaway

* [photogrammetry, computer vision, gis] and [deeplearning] should happen in separate docker containers and virtualenv setups
* VTK is the key software package to support 3D
* Most of the softwares like pcl, vtk, opencv allows Andoid builds, hence Android SDK, NDK should be installed in early stages itself
* android studio is the convenient way to install Android SDK and NDK
* latest android sdk will not be supported with vtk, opencv; so stick with v24 or check with the desired package
* upgrade CMAKE and CCMAKE early. cmake 3.7+ is required to build android with vtk. default with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS is 3.5+
* keep the data and software packages separate
* Install under `/usr/local/lib`. It saves lot of pain to export the path to individual build directories and system default libs will safely sit under `/usr/lib`.
* DO NOT uninstall system default components especially certain dependencies like imagemagic, cmake, openssl etc. This will have cascading effect and will possibly leave your entire system broken in some places which will bite you at unexpected time
* set the exports properly, maily SDK home paths (java, android sdk & ndk)
* Enabling userdir module for apache allows to have each user to host individual apache root directory. I prefer this setup instead of running as sudo or chown alternatives
* this setup was more inclined towards single user, single system setup and for server or server like setup will have a little variation as one would like all users to be able to use the same software stack possibly installed by a sysadmin user.
* server or server like setup will have common group and multiple users
* In the network and resource sharing, 3 level git setup may be attractive for development purpose where individual users will pull from the local server and the serve would clone from github resources. This way every individual would have sort of consistent software stack/components that avoids unnecessary software issues
* every system build is unqiue and is suspectible to the **[butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect)** `;)`
* Installing ROS on the deep learning system will possibly mess it up according to an experience shared over internet

### Jul 2018

* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS released in Apr-2018, preferred if setting up from scratch
* Support and other build seems to be working good so far with minor enhancements in the scripts
* tensorRT released with CUDA 9.1 support
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
  * cmake 3.10.2: manual build upgrade not required in most of the cases
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
  * cmake 3.5: manual build upgrade required

### May 2018

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS is a better option to stick with instead of using Ubuntu 17+
* Latest hardware has additional cost of compiling every other major opensource software from source
* CUDA 9.0 vs CUDA 9.1
  * Deep Learning frameworks have CUDA 9.0 widely supported compared to CUDA 9.1
  * Installing CUDA 9.1 compelled to compile tensorflow, as CUDA 9.1 was not supported in bin installation
  * tensorRT was only avaiable with CUDA 9.0 support, It's propriatory hence at mercy of Nvidia to release CUDA 9.1 supported version.
  * If tensorRT is required check CUDA version support before installing CUDA
  * DriveWork from Nvidia requires tensorRT, hence install CUDA 9.0
* boost 1.64.0 instead of 1.67.0 is safer version to install
* Computer Graphics (like gimp, inkscape, krita etc), VFX (natron, blender, fusion) software stack are self contained and easier to install anywhere at least on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* 3D GIS takes the leap with qGIS-3 release, but its little hard to install/build on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

### What Could have been a better Setup

* virtualenv setups for different toolchains with python2 and python3 running in separate virtual env
* docker container setups for intrusive software pipeline i.e. that has multiple dependencies, different version compatibility issues like OpenDroneMap

### Word of CAUTION

* **Be careful** on installing and uninstalling openssl1.1.0. There are breaking changes in 1.1.1 verison compared to openssl1.0.0 
* **Be careful** on running `sudo apt autoremove` and always check what gets uninstalled.
* **The install scripts are crafted to take care repeatable job, they are not perfect, always open and read it before executing them**


## Ubuntu 18.04 LTS - Sequence of Software Installed
> Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

* Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* **Configuration:**
  - Assumes softwares are downloaded at path: `$HOME/Downloads`
  - Assumes softwares are extracted and installed at path: `$HOME/softwares`
* **Software Version:**
  - defines the softwate's `versions/builds/release` to download
* **Naming Convention:**
  - If downloaded as tar/bz/bz2 files, same name is used to extract and build it from sources
  - Git cloned does not have version name appended to the folder so far, and assume to use the latest sources.
    - This may be an issue for people who needs specific version/build/release. - [TBD]
* **Without GPU**
  - Skip gpu specific installation steps/scripts: Nvidia, CUDA, TensorRT
  - When building from source GPU support should be disabled in pcl, vtk and other library
* **TBD:**
  - For git clone include `checkout` option to build from the stable release (case-by-case basis)
  - Check for versionfor `Ubuntu 16.04 / 18.04` and create the checks in the scripts to install respective dependencies

* **[Ccache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ccache)**
  - ccache is a software development tool that caches the output of C/C++ compilation so that the next time, the same compilation can be avoided and the results can be taken from the cache. This can greatly speed up recompiling time. The detection is done by hashing different kinds of information that should be unique for the compilation and then using the hash sum to identify the cached output.
* **[CloudCompare](http://www.danielgm.net/cc/)**
  - CloudCompare [github]](https://github.com/CloudCompare/CloudCompare) is a 3D point cloud (and triangular mesh) processing software. It was originally designed to perform comparison between two 3D points clouds (such as the ones obtained with a laser scanner) or between a point cloud and a triangular mesh. It relies on an octree structure that is highly optimized for this particular use-case. It was also meant to deal with huge point clouds (typically more than 10 millions points, and up to 120 millions with 2 Gb of memory).
