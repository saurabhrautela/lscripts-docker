# Lscripts Docker
> Linux Scripts For Deep Learning Projects

Lscripts Docker just happened to come into existence as a part of my personal research work. It was an attempt to reduce my manual effort to setup my systems. I hope you will discover some cool tricks using it and surely will develop the love-hate relationship with `lscripts-docker` framework.


* [Quick start](docs/_posts/2021-05-07-introduction-to-lscripts-docker.md)
* [Blog](https://skillplot.github.io/lscripts-docker)


## Custom Dockers

* Nvidia CUDA Docker based images for ML/AI Computer Vision Development
* MongoDB


## Todo

* or make better is to create select list of commands being exposed and not the actual function name using associative array and provide menu to the user to select which command to excecute
* share the python virtual environment with the host machine
* package and release to apt repo


Docker
* check if docker with same hostname inside docker is valid for multiple container networking or docker hostname for each container is to be different; in other words what's the implication of hostname being same or different inside the docker container


## Call for contribution

* Code review, documentation
* These functionalities with modular and multiple scripts imports gives slowless in starting the scripts - any help or suggestion is much appreciated
* Bug fixes, enhancements, pull requests
