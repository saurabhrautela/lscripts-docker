## About

`Lscripts Docker` or `lsd` is a collection of shell scipts, designed to be installed per-user, and invoked per-shell. `lsd` **should work** on any POSIX-compliant shell (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash), but it's developed and tested on `bash` in particular to `Ubuntu 18.04 LTS`.

## Installation
> wip: work-in-progress

To install or update `lsd`, you should run the install script. To do that, you may either download and run the script manually, or use the following `cURL` or `Wget` command:


```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skillplot/lscripts-docker/main/install.sh | bash
```

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skillplot/lscripts-docker/main/install.sh | bash
```

Running either of the above commands downloads a script and runs it. The script clones the `lscripts-docker` repository to `~/.lscripts-docker`, and attempts to add the source lines from the snippet below to the correct profile file: `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.bashrc`).
* bash: `source ~/.bashrc`
* zsh: `source ~/.zshrc`
* ksh: `. ~/.profile`


1. Clone the repo
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/skillplot/lscripts-docker.git
    ```
2. Put the following in the end of the `~/.bashrc` file. Change the path where you cloned the repo:
    ```bash
    export LSCRIPTS_DOCKER="/<replace_this_with_basepath>/lscripts-docker"
    [ -f ${LSCRIPTS_DOCKER}/lscripts/lscripts.env.sh ] && source ${LSCRIPTS_DOCKER}/lscripts/lscripts.env.sh
    ```


## Verify Installation

To verify that `lscripts-docker` has been installed, do:

```bash
command -v lsd-ls
```
